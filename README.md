-----
### Term project guideline
* All individual projects will be maintained in the [Github `IBT618` repository](https://github.com/igchoi/IBT618-SystemsBiotechnology/2024-spring/)
  * What is `Git` and `Github`?
    * [생활코딩 Git](https://opentutorials.org/module/3733/22434)
    * [What is `Github`?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)
    * __it is not an obligation__
* Use `markdown` for documentation

  * [Markdown tutorial - Korean](https://github.com/biospin/BigBio/blob/master/reference/%EB%A7%88%ED%81%AC%EB%8B%A4%EC%9A%B4.md)
* You can use [`jupyter notebook`](https://jupyter.org/) too
* Check [library](https://library.korea.ac.kr/) - there are plenty of reference books for python codings
* __Evaluation is on your *activity* rather than your *performance* (e.g. how frequently commit/update your codes/documents/discussions)__

### Term projects 
- You can choose following topics or suggest your own term project
- In following weeks, everyone will present and discuss about his/her intro/progress/issues/results, including 
  - i) what is the problem to solve? (_topic description/introduction_), 
  - ii) why is it important? (_biological meaning_), 
  - iii) how it can be solved (_algorithms/procedures_) - _how do you solve the problem?_ 
- Some projects are mostly related to `indexing` and `pattern matching` of sequences, which was handled in the previous class hours.
