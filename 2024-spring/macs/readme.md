## Titile : Counting single cell-encapsulated alginate microparticles from microscopic images
-----
### Introduction
#### Background
* Single Cell Analysis
The interesting technique the can give the precised results without cell-to-cell variation and cell-to-cell interaction. It can be used with since bacteria cells to animal cells. This single cell analysis can be used for exploring more information of minor population. Therefore, it will be useful in various aspects such as small molecule detection, whole genomr sequencing and antibiotic resistance detection.
