## Titile : Counting single cell-encapsulated alginate microparticles from microscopic images
-----
### Introduction
#### Background

#### Single Cell Analysis

* The interesting technique the can give the precised results without cell-to-cell variation and cell-to-cell interaction. It can be used with since bacteria cells to animal cells. This single cell analysis can be used for exploring more information of minor population. Therefore, it will be useful in various aspects such as small molecule detection, whole genomr sequencing and antibiotic resistance detection.

#### Alginate Microparticles

*Encapsulation technique is necessary thing for single cell studying. This technique can protect cells and  avoid the contamination. Alginate is the one of the best polymer used for encapsulation of cells because of its biocompartibility and low cost. Alginate will be gelatinized by calcium ion (called egg-box model) and normally formed as spherical shape.

* For using the alginate microparticles in the aspect of single cell analysis, size and the number of microparticles is neccessary point and should be considered
