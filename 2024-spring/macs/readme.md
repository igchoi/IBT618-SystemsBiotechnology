## Titile : Counting single cell-encapsulated alginate microparticles from microscopic images
-----
### Introduction
#### Background

##### 1. Single Cell Analysis

* The interesting technique the can give the precised results without cell-to-cell variation and cell-to-cell interaction. It can be used with since bacteria cells to animal cells. This single cell analysis can be used for exploring more information of minor population. Therefore, it will be useful in various aspects such as small molecule detection, whole genomr sequencing and antibiotic resistance detection.

##### 2. Alginate Microparticles

* Encapsulation technique is necessary thing for single cell studying. This technique can protect cells and  avoid the contamination. Alginate is the one of the best polymer used for encapsulation of cells because of its biocompartibility and low cost. Alginate will be gelatinized by calcium ion (called egg-box model) and normally formed as spherical shape.

* For using the alginate microparticles in the aspect of single cell analysis, size and the number of microparticles is neccessary point and should be considered

#### Question to be solved by class project
* As mention above, morphology, size, and also number of alginate microparticles is important factors for using in single cell analysis and also other works. Normally, morphology, size, and number of alginate microparticles can be calculated by ImageJ from microscopic capture. However, it can analyze only one picture per process and the gained result willl be analyzed again for making "histogram" or tendency graph by other applications.

* Therefore, it will be better if some program can be used to analyze alginate microparticles in the aspect of size, number, and circularity of whole sample pictures as once and display the results as histogram of size of nanoparticle or tendency graph. In this study, R programm will be used for improving the analyzing algiante microparticles process as workflow below :
