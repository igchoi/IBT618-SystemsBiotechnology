## Developing analysis pipelines for circRNA-seq data
### Introduction
#### Background
circRNA is a non-coding RNA(ncRNA) that forms covalently closed loop and often acts as a gene regulator in mammals. It is generated by backsplicing of exons and lariat introns (Fig. 1 in [Ref1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2017.00038/full)). circRNAs are evolutionary conserved and known to be relatively stable in cytoplasms. Its molecular function is acting as miRNA sponge or binding to RNA-associated proteins. The identification of circRNA is possible from typical ncRNAseq data. The target sequencing requires a specific experimental procedure and computational method to enrich or identify circRNAs from typical cytoplasmic ncRNAs.

Fig. 1 in [Ref1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2017.00038/full) circRNA splicing. circRNAs are created by non-canonical splicing process known as “backsplicing.” A downstream splice donor is joined to an upstream splice acceptor. circRNAs can be exonic, intronic or a combination of both. Colored bars = exons. Black lines = introns.

In this class project, I will download the public ncRNAseq data from [SRA NCBI]() and practice the processing of data using the workflow of cirRNA-seq analysis is in the following figure of [Ref2](). The raw data is available from the [SRA]() database under the [Bioproject ID: PRJNA1019680](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1019680). The analytic procedure in the original publication is followed.

```
The paired-end raw reads were trimmed, and the quality was controlled by Trimmomatic (v0.39)18 and FastQC (v0.11.9)
with default parameters. The genome website provided the reference genome and gene model annotation files directly.
The Hisat2 v2.0.5 tool was used to build the index of the reference genome and align paired-end clean reads to the
reference genome. Hisat2 was chosen as the mapping tool due to its capability to generate a splice junction database
based on the gene model annotation file, which provided improved mapping results. We used find_circ19 and CIRI220
to detect and identify circRNAs. First, BWA21 was used to compare the clean data with the reference genome.
Then, CIRI scans SAM files and detects junction reads with paired chiastic clipping (PCC) signals,
paired end mapping (PEM) and GT-AG splicing signals.
Find_circ obtains junction reads via Bowtie222. The circos figure was constructed utilizing the Circos software.
The DESeq2 R package (1.20.0) was utilized to perform differential expression analysis for two conditions/groups
(with two biological replicates per condition).
