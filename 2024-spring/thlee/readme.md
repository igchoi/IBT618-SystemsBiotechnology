# Class project
## Title: Developing analysis pipelines for cirRNA-seq data
-----
### Introduction
#### Background
* what is cirRNA?
  - non-coding RNA(ncRNA) that forms covalently closed loop and acts as a gene regulator in mammals.
  - generated by backsplicing of exons and lariat introns.
  - evolutionary conserved and relatively stable in cytoplasm.
  - acts as miRNA sponge or binds to RNA-associated proteins
