## Developing analysis pipelines for circRNA-seq data
### Introduction
#### Background
circRNA is a non-coding RNA(ncRNA) that forms covalently closed loop and often acts as a gene regulator in mammals. It is generated by backsplicing of exons and lariat introns (Fig. 1 in [Ref1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2017.00038/full)). circRNAs are evolutionary conserved and known to be relatively stable in cytoplasms. Its molecular function is acting as miRNA sponge or binding to RNA-associated proteins. The identification of circRNA is possible from typical ncRNAseq data. The target sequencing requires a specific experimental procedure and computational method to enrich or identify circRNAs from typical cytoplasmic ncRNAs.

Fig. 1 in [Ref1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2017.00038/full) circRNA splicing. circRNAs are created by non-canonical splicing process known as “backsplicing.” A downstream splice donor is joined to an upstream splice acceptor. circRNAs can be exonic, intronic or a combination of both. Colored bars = exons. Black lines = introns.
